Fractured Space Bootstrapper, alternative to the Bootlegger.

This is a 3rd party launcher for FS to re-enable multiplayer functionality

- Automates the patching of the final version of FS on steam to allow:
  * Use of an alternate backend: https://lifeline.returnvector.net/
  * Re-implements a mutiplayer server browser
  * Removes Steam authentication replacing it with Discord
  * Allows new players who don't *own* the free game to play
- Automates the new Discord authentication process
